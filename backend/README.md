# Backend - Trivia API

## Setting up the Backend
 
### Install Dependencies

1. **Python 3.7** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

2. **Virtual Environment** - We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once your virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Key Pip Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use to handle the lightweight SQL database. You'll primarily work in `app.py`and can reference `models.py`.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross-origin requests from our frontend server.

### Set up the Database

With Postgres running, create a `trivia` database:

```bash
createdb trivia
```

Populate the database using the `trivia.psql` file provided. From the `backend` folder in terminal run:

```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```
If anything wrong happend with database in your project development on going or you want back to original data, you can drop database and repopulate it again by : 
    ```bash 
      dropdb trivia 
      ```
then repeat the above actions.

### Run the Server

From within the `./src` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

From within the `backend` directory

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

## Contributions : 

These are the files that have been changed in this project :

1. `backend/flaskr/__init__.py`
2. `backend/test_flaskr.py`

For contributors : for each endpoint, you are expected to define the endpoint and response data. The frontend will be a plentiful resource because it is set up to expect certain endpoints and response data formats already. You should feel free to specify endpoints in your own way; if you do so, make sure to update the frontend or you will get some unexpected behavior.

 ** What have been done in this project so far ; You will find more details about end point in the next section 
1. Flask-CORS has benn enabled cross-domain requests and set response headers.
2. Endpoint to handle `GET` requests for questions, including pagination (every 10 questions). This endpoint should return a list of questions, number of total questions, current category, categories.
3. An endpoint to handle `GET` requests for all available categories.
4. An endpoint to `DELETE` a question using a question `ID`.
5. Create an endpoint to `POST` a new question, which will require the question and answer text, category, and difficulty score.
6. Create a `POST` endpoint to get questions based on category.
7. Create a `POST` endpoint to get questions based on a search term. It should return any questions for whom the search term is a substring of the question.
8. Create a `POST` endpoint to get questions to play the quiz. This endpoint take a category and previous question parameters and return a random questions within the given category, if provided, and that is not one of the previous questions.
9. Create error handlers for all expected errors including 400, 404, 422, and 500.

## API Endpoint Documentation

This project count some endpoint url demonstrated below, using curl command after lunching the backend server with the specific http request (GET/POST/DELETE...) is recommended to demonstrate the api functioning. 

### GET /categories :
- General: 
  - Returns all the categories.

development project is not using 
`GET '/api/v1.0/categories'`unstead connect to this url in your browser :
http://localhost:5000/categories
or lunch it from command line Terminal :
```bash
`curl 127.0.0.1:5000/categories'
```

- Fetches a dictionary of categories in which the keys are the ids and the value is the corresponding string of the category
- Request Arguments: None
- Returns: An object with a single key, `categories`, that contains an object of `id: category_string` key: value pairs.

#### POST /questions/search

- This endpoint is using a search term in the front end and compare it with similar result in the backend of the api, then it's displays similar 'questions' result as output

demo : `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/questions/search -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"searchTerm": "1990"}' `
if post request have been succeed, you will get a json output that contains : 
    -- question with similar search term
    -- total matched questions displayed

{
  "questions": [
    {
      "answer": "Edward Scissorhands", 
      "category": 5,

## Testing

Testing library used in this project is "Unit Test"
AT least one endpoint has been tested in python file named:
  - test_flaskr.py

To deploy the tests, run

```bash
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```
